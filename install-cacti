Installing Apache2

Apache2 is available as a Fedora package, therefore we can install it like this:

yum install httpd

Now configure your system to start Apache at boot time...

systemctl enable httpd.service

... and start Apache:

systemctl start httpd.service



 Installing MySQL/MariaDB 5

To install MariaDB, we do this:

yum install mariadb mariadb-server

Then we create the system startup links for MariaDB (so that MariaDB starts automatically whenever the system boots) and start the MariaDB server:

systemctl enable mariadb.service

Further start the service of mysql

systemctl start mariadb.service

Run

mysql_goweekend_installation

to set a password for the user root (otherwise anybody can access your MySQL database!):

[root@server1 ~]# mysql_goweekend_installation



Installing PHP5

We can install PHP5 and the Apache PHP5 module as follows:

yum install php

We must restart Apache afterwards:

systemctl restart httpd.service

 Getting MySQL Support In PHP5

To get MySQL support in PHP, we can install the php-mysql package. It's a good idea to install some other PHP5 modules as well as you might need them for your applications. You can search for available PHP5 modules like this:

yum search php

Pick the ones you need and install them like this:

yum install php-mysqlnd php-mssql php-opcache

Now restart Apache2:

systemctl restart httpd.service
